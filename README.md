### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the my GitHub Page. For some reason the index.html is not showing @ https://palmer81.github.io/palmer81 or https://palmer81.github.io. If someone knows whats wrong by looking at the repo please contact me palmer.sr@gmail.com. I can't get the the page to show. I've looked https://pages.github.com/, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51883727/my-github-page-wont-load/51903879
